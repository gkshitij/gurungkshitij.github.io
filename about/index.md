<strong> <center> I am Kshitij Gurung and welcome to my Website!</center></strong> 
I am a motivated learner with a great passion for data science and analytics. I throughly enjoy playing with data, revealing interesting patters, explaining impactful stories, and motivating a data-driven decision. Since I am a very active person who loves technology, my interests lie in the intersection of data science, health care, sports & exercise, and fintech. Besides my professional work, you can find me speding time playing soccer, making cover songs, working out (powerlifting), hair cutting, fishing, or cooking.
