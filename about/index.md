<strong> <center> I am Kshitij Gurung and welcome to my Website!</center></strong> 
I am a motivated learner with a great passion for data science and analytics. I enjoy playing with data and revealing interesting patterns that unpacks impactful stories in a fun visualization. My interests lie in the intersection of data science and health care, sports & exercise, and fintech. Besides my professional work, I love speding time playing soccer, singing, working out (powerlifting), cooking, and hair cutting.
