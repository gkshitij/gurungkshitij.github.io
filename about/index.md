<strong> <center> I am Kshitij Gurung and welcome to my Website!</center></strong> 
I am a motivated learner with a great passion for data science and analytics. I recently graduated from St. Olaf College with a Bachelor in Economics, Mathematics, Statistics and Data Science. I enjoy playing with data and producing information that convey a compelling story. My interests lie in the intersection of data science and health care, sports & exercise, and econometrics. Besides my professional work, I love speding time playing soccer, working out (powerlifting), cooking, hair cutting, and Singnig.
