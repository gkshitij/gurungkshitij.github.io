<strong> <center> My name is Kshitij Gurung. Welcome to my Website!</center></strong> 
<hr />
I am a motivated learned with a great passion for data science. I recently graduated from St. Olaf College with a bachelor is Economics, Mathematics, and Statistics. I have strong quantative research experiences in various fields (Biostatistics, Healthcare Economics, and Ecology). Currenlty, I am actively looking for jobs in healthcare, economic consulting, business, and innovative technology that demand heavy use of data analytics, statistical analysis, predictive modeling skills, and econometrics to solve challenging real-world problems. I am skilled in Data Analysis, Data Visualisation, Machine Learning Algorithms, and Statistics.

 Besides my professional work, I love speding time playing soccer, working outs (powerlifting), cooking, hair cutting, and Singnig.
