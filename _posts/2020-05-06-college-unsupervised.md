## Introduction:

In this project, I attempt to classify, compare, and study 135 different private colleges in the U.S. bsaed on 14 different variables like admission rate, averaet SAT score, percentage on white and non-white, faculty salary, etc. I implement Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-means clustering to achieve my goal.
